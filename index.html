## General components of Technical SEO
</section>
<section data-markdown>
A typical Technical SEO audit from a professional SEO firm will cover the following basics:
- On-Page SEO
- Site Architecture
- SERP Visibility
- Usability

We'll cover each of these during this presentation.
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Start with a good foundation
Building blocks of good technical SEO
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Find a good dedicated WordPress host
- Takes care of a lot of the basics for a couple extra bucks
- Easy installs, free ssl certs, security, backups, caching (speed), cdn, they manage the network and machines
</section>
<!--
<section data-markdown>
Some dedicated WordPress hosts:
- Pantheon
- WP Engine
- Flywheel
</section>
-->
<section data-markdown>
## Find a good, well supported, and highly rated theme
- Proper symantic markup
- Plays well with plugins
- Responsive
- Supported
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Install and Configure WordPress
Configuring WordPress Settings
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## General
* Add a descriptive "Site Title"
* Add a descriptive "Tagline" (relatively unused, but clears alerts)
* Set your "Timezone"
* Often overlooked: not too SEO related, but helps with Scheduled Posts, and general sanity check
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Add a descriptive title and tagline.

Set your timezone: not too SEO related, but helps with Scheduled Posts, and general sanity check
![](images/wordpress-settings-general-test-part-2.png)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Reading 
* Be sure "Search Engine Visibility" is unchecked
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Discussion
- Optional: turn off pingbacks and trackbacks
- Was once good for SEO, but I haven't seen a good one in 2 years (adds to your comment moderation queue)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Permalinks
- Probably the most important settings
- Set as "Post name" or "Custom Structure"

![](images/wordpress-settings-permalinks.png)
</section>
</section>

- Optimize full size images or assign thumbnail sizes
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Headings and Semantic HTML

- Use semantic HTML to arrange your page information
- Be sure that h1 tags exist and that there is only 1 per page
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Site Architecture
The technical structure of your website
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Taking a look at your site's architecture:

- URL Structure
- Canonicalization
- Robots.txt
- XML Sitemap
- HTML Sitemap
- Crawl Test
- HTTP and HTTPS
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### URL Structure

- Generally looking for well-optimized and logical site organization
- Page heirarchy, directory structure, "siloing"
- A couple quick examples:

</section>
<section data-markdown>
A typical technology product company would organize products like so:
```
## Two products
https://sysdig.com/product/monitor/
https://sysdig.com/product/secure/
## Product pricing
https://sysdig.com/product/monitor/pricing/
https://sysdig.com/product/secure/pricing/
```
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Organizing "company" info:
```
https://qwilt.com/company/
https://qwilt.com/company/our-story/
https://qwilt.com/company/board/
https://qwilt.com/company/articles/
https://qwilt.com/company/press-releases/
```

Those are some quick examples, but this is a large subject in and of itself.

</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Canonicalization

- Canonicalization: unifying multiple pages of similar content
- Don't want multiple URLs serving the same content
- This is "duplicate content", you want to avoid that
- Make sure you serve a single version of your content
- Redirect non-www versions to www versions or vice versa
- Redirect all http traffic to https version of your site
</section>
<!--
<section data-markdown>
### Header Response Codes (Redirects)
</section>
-->
<!--
<section data-markdown>
### Pagination
</section>
-->
<section data-markdown>
### Robots.txt

- Robots.txt instructs search engines on how to crawl your site
- Make sure that you have one and it is in the right form
- Use Google Seach Console to test your robots.txt file
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### XML Sitemap

- Sitemaps instruct search engines on which pages to index
- If your site doesn't already have one create one
- Create a sitemap and submit to Google and Bing
- Configure your sitemap to display Posts, Pages, and other Post Types
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Crawl Test
- Crawl your site as Google does through Search Console
</section>
<section data-markdown>
![Search Console](images/search-console-fetch-as-google.png)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### HTTP and HTTPS
- Use HTTPS. This is not negotiable.
- Good hosts will provide free SSL certificates
	- or at least provide a simple path to it
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## SERP Visibility
How search engines see your site
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Taking a look at your site's SERP visibility:
- Uptime
- Pages Indexed (Sitemaps)
- Schema and Rich Snippets
- Site Indexation Issues (Crawl Errors)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Uptime 
Search engines need access to your site
- Your site must be up and malware-free to be indexed
- Google will blacklist malware infected sites
- Intermittent uptime and extremely low response times affect bounce rate
- Points for dedicated WordPress hosts
- Monitor uptime with: [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) 
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Pages Indexed (Sitemaps)
- Check that your pages are being indexed
- Make sure they're not over-indexing your site
- Back to Canonicalization and robots.txt, noindex setting
- You can 'Disallow' or noindex Categories and Tags
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Schema and Rich Snippets
- Add organization and sitelinks search schema
- Check/test for schema markup errors
- Yoast SEO plugin creates Website and Organization schema markup
- This is a large topic that can't be covered here, but you can start with an organization tag:
</section>
<section data-markdown>
You can paste in custom Schema markup:
```
{
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "Organization",
    "url": "https://www.kentik.com",
    "potentialAction": {
        "@type": "SearchAction",
        "target": "https://www.kentik.com/?s={search_term_string}",
        "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
    },
    "logo": "https://wpcdn.kentik.com/wp-content/themes/kentik/assets/img/kentik-logo.png",
    "contactPoint" : [
    { "@type" : "ContactPoint",
    "telephone" : "+1 844-356-3278",
    "contactType" : "customer service"
    } ],
    "sameAs" : [ "https://www.facebook.com/kentiktech",
    "https://twitter.com/kentikinc",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/kentik"]
}
```
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Yoast provides Website and Organization Schema markup:
```
{
   "@context":"http:\/\/schema.org",
   "@type":"WebSite",
   "@id":"#website",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.sentient.ai\/",
   "name":"Sentient Technologies Holdings Limited",
   "potentialAction":{
      "@type":"SearchAction",
      "target":"https:\/\/www.sentient.ai\/?s={search_term_string}",
      "query-input":"required name=search_term_string"
   }
}
{
   "@context":"http:\/\/schema.org",
   "@type":"Organization",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.sentient.ai\/",
   "sameAs":[

   ],
   "@id":"#organization",
   "name":"Sentient Technologies",
   "logo":"https:\/\/www.sentient.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/logo-sentient-black-1.svg"
}
```
