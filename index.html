We'll cover each of these during this presentation.
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Start with a good foundation
Building blocks of good technical SEO
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Find a good dedicated WordPress host
- Takes care of a lot of the basics for a couple extra bucks
- Easy installs, free ssl certs, security, backups, caching (speed), cdn, they manage the network and machines
</section>
<!--
<section data-markdown>
Some dedicated WordPress hosts:
- Pantheon
- WP Engine
- Flywheel
</section>
-->
<section data-markdown>
## Find a good, well supported, and highly rated theme
- Proper symantic markup
- Plays well with plugins
- Responsive
- Supported
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Install and Configure WordPress
Configuring WordPress Settings
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## General
* Add a descriptive "Site Title"
* Add a descriptive "Tagline" (relatively unused, but clears alerts)
* Set your "Timezone"
* Often overlooked: not too SEO related, but helps with Scheduled Posts, and general sanity check
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Add a descriptive title and tagline.

Set your timezone: not too SEO related, but helps with Scheduled Posts, and general sanity check

</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Reading 
* Be sure "Search Engine Visibility" is unchecked
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Discussion
- Optional: turn off pingbacks and trackbacks
- Was once good for SEO, but I haven't seen a good one in 2 years (adds to your comment moderation queue)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
## Permalinks
- Probably the most important settings
- Set as "Post name" or "Custom Structure"

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## Site Architecture
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Taking a look at your site's architecture:

- URL Structure
- Canonicalization
- Pagination
- Robots.txt
- XML Sitemap
- HTML Sitemap
- Header Response Codes
- Crawl Test
- HTTP and HTTPS
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### URL Structure

* Don not explain this stuff too much. Explain what you need to do to manage and fix it (technical seo)

- Use logical directory paths
- Place blog under /blog/

A typical technical product company will have a URL structure that looks like this:
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Canonicalization

- They will point out things like:
- Avoid duplicate content
- Canonicalization: unifying multiple pages of similar content
- Redirect non-www versions to www versions or vice versa
- Redirect all http traffic to https version of site
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Robots.txt

- Robots.txt instructs search engines on how to crawl your site
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### XML Sitemap

- Sitemaps instruct search engines on which pages to index
- If your site doesn't already have one create one
- Create a sitemap and submit to Google and Bing
- Configure your sitemap to display Posts, Pages, and other Post Types
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Header Response Codes (Redirects)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Crawl Test
- Crawl your site as Google does through Search Console
</section>
<section data-markdown>
![Search Console](images/search-console-fetch-as-google.png)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### HTTP and HTTPS
- Use HTTPS. This is not negotiable.
- Good hosts will provide free SSL certificates
	- or at least provide a simple path to it
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section data-markdown>
## SERP Visibility
How search engines see your site
</section>
<section data-markdown>
- Uptime
- Crawl Test
- Header Response Codes (Redirects)
- Pages Indexed (Sitemaps) + Bing?
- Schema and Rich Snippets
- Knowledge Graph & Sitelinks
- Site Indexation Issues (Crawl Errors)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Uptime 
Search engines need access to your site
- Your site must be up and malware-free to be indexed
- Google will blacklist malware infected sites
- Intermittent uptime and extremely low response times affect bounce rate
- Points for dedicated WordPress hosts
- Monitor uptime with: [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) 
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Pages Indexed (Sitemaps) + Bing
- Check that your pages are bing indexed
- Google and Bing
- Make sure they're not over-indexing your site
  - Back to Canonicalization and robots.txt, noindex setting
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Schema and Rich Snippets
- markup site with organization and sitelinks search schema
- check/test for schema markup errors
- this is a large topic that can't be covered here, but you can start with an organization tag:

```
schema markup for organization

- does Yoast handle it?
```
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Knowledge Graph & Sitelinks
- apply organizational schema.org markup to ensure knowlege graph fully populates
</section>
<section data-markdown>
### Site Indexation Issues (Crawl Errors)
- check for index errors
- check for extra indexing (extra domains)
- want it to roughly match the amount of links in your sitemap
</section>
